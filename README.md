Get Informed

In today's world of biased, questionable journalism, this app allows users to compare news sources side-by-side to evaluate their respective reporting.  In this iteration, the app is using two sources: The New York Times, and The Guardian (a UK-based news service).  

To use the app, the user inputs a search term in the search box, and clicks the search button.  The app will then populate 10 headlines from each news source, side-by-side on the page.  Each headline is a link to the article itself.

In future iterations, we hope to add functionality to choose different news sources, choose headlines by time period, regioan, etc.
